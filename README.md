# Rain-on-Snow Event Animator Widget

This widget can really be used for any type of animation composed of discrete
images as frames. I have to think more about the interface before advertising
this as a generic animation widget tool.


## TODO

- Decide on parameter format. Maybe:
  - URL to a `manifest.json` containing URLs to images
  - URL to a `.gif`
  - URL to a `.mp4`
  - URL to a spritesheet
  - Something else?

- Deliver widget as a Web Component instead of using the usual React
  div-injection method.
